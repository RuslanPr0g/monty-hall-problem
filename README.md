# Monty Hall Problem Simulator 🎰

This project simulates the Monty Hall problem and provides an interactive chart comparing the outcomes of the "Switching" vs. "No Switching" strategies. You can adjust the number of simulations with a slider and see how the results change in real-time.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites 📋

1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (Recommended for interactive widgets)

### Install Dependencies 🔧

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/monty-hall-simulator.git
   cd monty-hall-simulator
   ```
````

2. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or manually install:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib ipywidgets
   ```

### Run the Simulation 🖥️

1. Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the `monty_hall_simulator.ipynb` file in Jupyter.

3. Run the notebook cells. An interactive slider will appear, allowing you to adjust the number of simulations.

4. The chart will update in real-time based on your selected number of simulations. You can compare the "Switching" and "No Switching" strategies visually.

### Usage 💡

- **Slider**: Adjust the number of simulations (1 to 5000).
- **Chart**: Displays the percentage of correct guesses for both "Switching" and "No Switching" strategies.

## 📈 Example Output

After adjusting the slider, you'll see a graph showing two lines:

- **No Switching**: The percentage of correct guesses when the contestant does not switch.
- **Switching**: The percentage of correct guesses when the contestant switches doors.
